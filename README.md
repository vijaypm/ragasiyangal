# Ragasiyangal is a Password Manager


## Motivation
The motivation for this project is two-fold:
1. Can you have a simple and secure password manager whose code can be easily audited ?
2. Can you have password manager without an expensive (from compute perspective) server or database ?

The answer is 'yes'. 

This project encapsulates all the logic into a single python module, and has no external server or database dependencies.
